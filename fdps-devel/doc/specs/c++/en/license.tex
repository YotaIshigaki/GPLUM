The extended feature ``Particle Mesh" is implemented by using a module of \textsc{GreeM} code (Developers: Tomoaki Ishiyama and Keigo Nitadori) (Ishiyama, Fukushige \& Makino 2009, Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, 61, 1319; Ishiyama, Nitadori \& Makino, 2012 SC'12 Proceedings of the International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking Stroage and Analysis, No. 5). \textsc{GreeM} code is developed based on the code in Yoshikawa \& Fukushige (2005, Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, 57, 849). Please cite these three literatures if you use the extended feature ``Particle Mesh". 

Please cite Tanikawa et al.(2012, New Astronomy, 17, 82) and Tanikawa et al.(2012, New Astronomy, 19, 74) if you use the extended feature ``Phantom-GRAPE for x86".
