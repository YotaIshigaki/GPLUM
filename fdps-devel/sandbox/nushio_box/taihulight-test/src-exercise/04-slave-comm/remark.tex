Communicating between CPEs

CPEs form an 8x8 array, and
we can send the data in the row or the column direction in the CPE array.

The intrinsic functions
\verb`simd_putr` and
\verb`simd_putc` are used to send the data in the row nad the column direction, while
\verb`simd_getr` and
\verb`simd_getc` are used to recieve the data.

The second argument to the
\verb`simd_putr` and
\verb`simd_putc` functions
is the destination address. The address can be one of
(0...7) which specifies a column/row. The address can also be 8,
which means a broadcast.


%%%%

We have confirmed that
\verb`simd_putr` sends the data in the row direction, and
\verb`simd_putc` sends the data in the column direction.
