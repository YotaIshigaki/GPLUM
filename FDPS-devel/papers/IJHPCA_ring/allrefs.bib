	abstract = {While periodic checkpointing has been an important mechanism for tolerating faults in high-performance computing (HPC) systems, it is cost-prohibitive as the HPC system approaches exascale. Applying compression techniques is one common way to mitigate such burdens by reducing the data size, but they are often found to be less effective for scientific datasets. Traditional lossless compression techniques that look for repeated patterns are ineffective for scientific data in which high-precision data is used and hence common patterns are rare to find. In this paper, we present a comparison of several lossless and lossy data compression algorithms and discuss their methodology under the exascale environment. As data volume increases, we discover an increasing trend of new domain-driven algorithms that exploit the inherent characteristics exhibited in many scientific dataset, such as relatively small changes in data values from one simulation iteration to the next or among neighboring data. In particular, significant data reduction has been observed in lossy compression. This paper also discusses how the errors introduced by lossy compressions are controlled and the tradeoffs with the compression ratio.},

title="Direct Schur complement method by domain decomposition based on H-matrix approximation",
journal="Computing and Visualization in Science",
year="2005",
volume="8",
number="3",
pages="179--188",
abstract="The goal of this paper is the construction of a data-sparse approximation to the Schur complement on the interface corresponding to FEM and BEM approximations of an elliptic equation by domain decomposition. Using the hierarchical (H-matrix) formats we elaborate the approximate Schur complement inverse in an explicit form. The required cost O (N                        $\Gamma$log                   q                                        N                        $\Gamma$) is almost linear in N                        $\Gamma$ -- the number of degrees of freedom on the interface. As input, we require the Schur complement matrices corresponding to subdomains and represented in the H-matrix format. In the case of piecewise constant coefficients these matrices can be computed via the BEM representation with the cost O(N                        $\Gamma$log                   q                                        N                        $\Gamma$), while in the general case the FEM discretisation leads to the complexity O(N                        $\Omega$log                   q                                        N                        $\Omega$), where N                        $\Omega$ is the number of degrees of freedom in the domain.",

abstract="The Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer is the world's first system with a peak performance greater than 100 PFlops. In this paper, we provide a detailed introduction to the TaihuLight system. In contrast with other existing heterogeneous supercomputers, which include both CPU processors and PCIe-connected many-core accelerators (NVIDIA GPU or Intel Xeon Phi), the computing power of TaihuLight is provided by a homegrown many-core SW26010 CPU that includes both the management processing elements (MPEs) and computing processing elements (CPEs) in one chip. With 260 processing elements in one CPU, a single SW26010 provides a peak performance of over three TFlops. To alleviate the memory bandwidth bottleneck in most applications, each CPE comes with a scratch pad memory, which serves as a user-controlled cache. To support the parallelization of programs on the new many-core architecture, in addition to the basic C/C++ and Fortran compilers, the system provides a customized Sunway OpenACC tool that supports the OpenACC 2.0 syntax. This paper also reports our preliminary efforts on developing and optimizing applications on the TaihuLight system, focusing on key application domains, such as earth system modeling, ocean surface wave modeling, atomistic simulation, and phase-field simulation.",
