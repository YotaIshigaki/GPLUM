We have developed a novel framework for particle-based simulations,
FDPS.  Users of FDPS need not care about complex implementations of
domain decomposition, exchange of particles, communication of data for
the interaction calculation, or optimization for multi-core
processors.  Using FDPS, particle simulation codes which achieve high
performance and high scalability on massively parallel
distributed-memory machines can be easily developed for a variety of
problems.  As we have shown in section~\ref{sec:samplecode}, a
parallel $N$-body simulation code can be written in less than 120
lines.  Example implementations of gravitational $N$-body simulation
and SPH simulation showed excellent scalability and performance. We
hope FDPS will help researchers to concentrate on their research, by
removing the burden of complex code development for parallization and
architecture-dependent tuning.
